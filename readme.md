The CabbageBot is a Discord Bot that is used to give an interactive demonstration for some of our projects.

But due to a large request, I decided to make the bot public available to any discord server.

# How to 
First, invite the bot to your server using [this](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=689510366958321878&scope=bot&permissions=8) link,
Now you can make use of the help command ``wet help`` to get a full list of commands.

Join our Discord server using [this](https://discord.gg/HSjuxCC) invite link, come say hi to both the bot and the developers!

Below is a list of features that give more details about the functionality of the bot.
